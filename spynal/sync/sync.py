"""
Analysis of oscillatory neural synchrony

This module is the base module for the `sync` module. It contains all the
high-level API functions. Lower-level functions can be found in the other sync modules.

Overview
--------
Contains functionality for computing oscillatory neural synchrony between pairs of
continuous signals (LFPs/EEGs/etc.) or between pairs of spiking and continuous signals
(ie spike-LFP pair).

Currently two types of synchrony methods, based on different theoretical frameworks, are available.
Coherence is based on the theory of linear stochastic processes, and is a frequency-domain analog
of standard (Pearson) correlation. Phase-based methods (phase-locking value, pairwise phase consistency)
are based on circular statistics, and are closely related to the length of the vector average of the
relative phases of a signal pair (eg phase difference between LFP pair or spike-triggered LFP phase).

Input data (for most functions) can either be raw data or data already spectrally-transformed
(using either functionality in the `spynal.spectra` module or users' own custom code). In either
case, any synchrony method can be combined with any underlying spectral method (eg wavelet,
multitaper, or bandfilter).

NOTE: Unlike other spynal functions that can run in parallel across multiple channels
("mass-univariate" analysis), these functions are currently set up to compute synchrony
on only a single pair of channels (2 LFPs or spike/LFP pair) at once.

Nevertheless, sync functions can perform operations in a mass-bivariate manner over all other
dimension. This means that rather than embedding function calls in for loops over frequencies,
timepoints, etc., like this::

    for f in frequencies:
        for t in timepoints:
            results[f,t] = compute_something(data[f,t],data2[f,t])

You can instead execute a single call on ALL the data, labeling the relevant axis
for the computation (usually trials/observations here), and it will run in parallel (vectorized)
across all frequencies, timepoints, etc. in the data, like this:

``results = compute_something(data1, data2, axis)``

    """
    Compute measure of synchrony between pair of channels of continuous (eg LFP)
    raw or spectral (time-frequency) data, using given estimation method

    Parameters
    ----------
    data1,data2 : ndarray, shape=(...,n_obs,...), dtype=float or complex
        Single-channel continuous (eg LFP) data for 2 distinct channels.
        Can be given as raw LFPs or complex-valued time-frequency transform.

        Trial/observation axis is assumed to be axis 0 unless given in `axis`.
        For raw data, axis corresponding to time must be given in `time_axis`.

        Other than those constraints, data can have arbitrary shape, with
        analysis performed in mass-bivariate fashion independently
        along each dimension other than observation `axis` (eg different
        frequencies, timepoints, conditions, etc.)

    axis : scalar, default: 0
        Axis corresponding to distinct observations/trials

    method : {'PPC','PLV','coherence'}, default: 'PPC'
        Synchrony estimation method:

        - 'PPC' : Pairwise Phase Consistency, measure of phase synchrony (see :func:`.ppc`)
        - 'PLV' : Phase Locking Value, measure of phase synchrony (see :func:`.plv`)
        - 'coherence' : coherence, measure of linear oscillatory coupling (see :func:`.coherence`)

    return_phase : bool, default: False
        If False, only return measure of synchrony magnitude/strength between data1 and data2.
        If True, also returns mean phase difference (or coherence phase) between
        data1 and data2 (in radians) in additional output.

    single_trial : str or None, default: None
        What type of coherence estimator to compute:

        - None :       standard across-trial estimator
        - 'pseudo' :   single-trial estimates using jackknife pseudovalues
        - 'richter' :  single-trial estimates using actual jackknife estimates cf. Richter 2015

    data_type : {'raw','spectral'}, default: assume 'raw' if data is real; 'spectral' if complex
        What kind of data is input: 'raw' or 'spectral'?

    spec_method : {'wavelet','multitaper','bandfilter'}, default: 'wavelet'
        Method to use for spectral analysis (only used for *raw* data)

    smp_rate : scalar
        Sampling rate of data (only needed for *raw* data)

    time_axis : int
        Axis of data corresponding to time (only needed for *raw* data)

    taper_axis : int
        Axis of spectral data corresponding to tapers (only needed for *multitaper spectral* data)

    keepdims : bool, default: True
        If True, retains reduced trial and/or taper axes as length-one axes in output.
        If False, removes reduced trial,taper axes from outputs.

    **kwargs :
        All other kwargs passed as-is to specific synchrony estimation function.

    Returns
    -------
    sync : ndarray, shape=
        Synchrony magnitude/strength (PPC/PLV/coherence) between data1 and data2.
        If data is spectral, this has same shape as data, but with `axis` reduced
        to a singleton or removed, depending on value of `keepdims`.
        If data is raw, this has same shape as data with `axis` reduced or removed
        and a new frequency axis inserted immediately before `time_axis`.

    freqs : ndarray, shape=(n_freqs,)
        List of frequencies in `sync`. Only returned for raw data, [] otherwise.

    timepts : ndarray, shape=(n_timepts_out,)
        List of timepoints in `sync` (in s, referenced to start of data).
        Only returned for raw data, [] otherwise.

    dphi : ndarray, optional
        Mean phase difference (or coherence phase) between data1 and data2 in radians.
        Same shape as `sync`.
        Positive values correspond to data1 leading data2.
        Negative values correspond to data1 lagging behind data2.
        Optional: Only returned if return_phase is True.

    Computs measure of pairwise coupling between a pair of spike and continuous (eg LFP)

    Parameters
    ----------
    spkdata : ndarray, shape=(...,n_obs,...), dtype=bool
        Single-channel binary spike trains (with 1's labelling spike times, 0's otherwise).

        For coherence: Can be given either as raw binary spike trains or as their spectral
        transform, but must have same data type (raw or spectral) and shape as `lfpdata`.

        For PLV/PPC: Shape is arbitrary, but MUST have same shape as `lfpdata`
        for raw `lfpdata`, and same dimensionality as `lfpdata` for spectral `lfpdata`.
        Thus, if `lfpdata` is spectral, must pre-pend singleton (length-1) axis to
        spkdata to match (eg using np.newaxis).

    lfpdata : ndarray, shape=(...,n_obs,...)
        Single-channel continuous (eg LFP) data.
        Can be given as raw LFPs or complex-valued time-frequency transform.

        Trial/observation axis is assumed to be axis 0 unless given in `axis`.
        For raw data, axis corresponding to time must be given in `time_axis`.

        Other than those constraints, data can have arbitrary shape, with analysis performed
        in mass-bivariate fashion independently along each axis other than observation `axis`
        (eg different frequencies, timepoints, conditions, etc.)

    axis : int, default: 0

        - 'PLV' : Phase Locking Value (see :func:`.spike_field_plv`)
        - 'coherence' : coherence (see :func:`.spike_field_coherence`)

    return_phase : bool, default: False
        If False, only return measure of synchrony magnitude/strength between data1 and data2.
        If True, also returns mean LFP phase of spikes (or coherence phase) in additional output.

    time_axis : int
        Axis of data corresponding to time. Required input for phase-based methods (PLV/PPC).
        For coherence, only needed for `data_type` = 'raw' AND `spec_method` = 'multitaper'.

    taper_axis : int
        Axis of spectral data corresponding to tapers. Only needed for multitaper spectral data.

    timepts : array-like, shape=(n_timepts,), default: (0 - n_timepts-1)/smp_rate
        Time sampling vector for data. Default value starts at 0, with spacing = 1/smp_rate.
        For phase methods, should be in same time units as `width`/`spacing`/`lims` or `timewins`.

    data_type : {'raw','spectral'}, default: assume 'raw' if data is real; 'spectral' if complex
        What kind of data is input: 'raw' or 'spectral'?

    spec_method : {'wavelet','multitaper','bandfilter'}, default: 'wavelet'
        Method to use for (or already used for) spectral analysis.
        NOTE: Must be input for multitaper spectral data, so taper axis is handled appropriately.
        Otherwise, only used for *raw* data.

    smp_rate : scalar
        Sampling rate of data (only needed for *raw* data)

    keepdims : bool, default: True
        If True, retains reduced trial and/or taper axes as length-one axes in output.
        If False, removes reduced trial,taper axes from outputs.

        All other kwargs passed as-is to specific synchrony estimation function.

    Returns
    -------
    sync : ndarray, shape=(...,[1,]...)
        Magnitude/strength of spike-field coupling (coherence or PLV/PPC magnitude).

        For phase-based methods, time windows without any spikes are set = np.nan.

        If lfpdata is spectral, this has same shape as lfpdata, but time axis reduced
        to n_timewins and with `axis` (and taper_axis as well for multitaper) reduced
        to length 1 if `keepdims` is True or removed if `keepdims` is False.

        If lfpdata is raw, this has the same shape as described above for spectral data,
        but with a new frequency axis (and also a taper axis if `spec_method`='multitaper`)
        inserted immediately before `time_axis`.
